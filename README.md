# Face-detection-JS

Simple face detection using JS, face-api.js (tensorflow) to play around with Face Detection and Vanilla JS. From Web Dev Simplified.

## Key elements for this exercise

It was a nice exercise to work with. It was nice to learn a bit more about:

- promises (which need to be studied more), methods like .then(), .catch()
- async functions (async, await)
- setInterval() function
- having a first grasp of the faceapi JS library (which has many methods, constructors etc.)
